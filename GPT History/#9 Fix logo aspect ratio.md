Prompt:
Thank you. My logo file has original dimensions of 4000x2250px. After applying all the CSS. The logo looks weird, like it's smashed and it doesn't look very good. 

GPT:
My apologies for the confusion. The issue is occurring because the aspect ratio of the logo is not maintained when resizing it using CSS. To fix this, update the .logo class in your src/App.css file:

css
Copy code
.logo {
  width: 180px;
  height: auto;
  margin: 20px;
}
By setting the height to auto, the browser will automatically calculate the height while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image. Now the logo should look better and not appear "smashed."

If you want to improve the logo's appearance further, consider optimizing the logo file itself:

Resize the logo: Since the logo's dimensions are quite large (4000x2250px), you can resize the logo to a smaller size with the same aspect ratio, such as 360x202px or 180x101px, using an image editing tool like GIMP or Photopea. This will reduce the file size, making it load faster on the website.

Convert the logo to an SVG: If your logo is a vector graphic, consider converting it to an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. SVGs are resolution-independent and will look sharp on all screen sizes and resolutions without increasing the file size.

Remember to update the logo import statement in your src/App.js file if you change the logo file's name or extension.

Prompt: 
CSS styles are not applied to my website. I've put them into App.css as you've suggested. But the form is aligned to the left side with 0 margin. And font is different from what we had previously before react app.

GPT:
Apologies for the confusion. It looks like there might be some conflicting styles in your React project. Let's resolve this issue by following these steps:

Step 1: Remove conflicting styles
Open the src/index.css file and delete all the styles there. This file contains some default styles that may conflict with the styles in App.css.

Step 2: Check the class names
Ensure that the class names in the src/App.js file match the ones in your src/App.css file. In this case, you should have the following class names:

container
hidden
Update the src/App.js file to include the container class:

javascript
Copy code
// ...
return (
  <div className="App container">
    {/*...*/}
  </div>
);
// ...
Step 3: Update the body styles
In the src/App.css file, update the body styles to target the .App class:

css
Copy code
.App {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* ...rest of the styles... */
Step 4: Verify the styles
Save your changes and check your website again. The styles should now be applied correctly.

If you still face any issues, please double-check that you've updated the class names and styles accordingly. Also, ensure that your browser cache is cleared or try viewing the website in an incognito/private browsing window.

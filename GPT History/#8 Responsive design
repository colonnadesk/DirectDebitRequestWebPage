Prompt:
Great job. Logo is there. Now lets make the website responsiveness as you've suggested in the beginning. Implement a responsive design: Ensure your website looks good and functions well on various screen sizes and devices. Please make sure that website is  visually appealing and engaging. Focus on great UI/UX as an senior designer.

GPT:
To make the website responsive and visually appealing, we'll use CSS media queries to apply styles based on the screen size. Update your src/App.css file with the following styles to make your website responsive:

css
Copy code
/* ...existing styles... */

/* Responsive design */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .form-container {
    width: 90%;
    padding: 30px;
  }

  input {
    font-size: 14px;
  }

  button {
    font-size: 14px;
  }

  .confirmation {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .logo {
    width: 150px;
    height: 40px;
  }

  .form-container {
    padding: 20px;
  }

  input {
    font-size: 12px;
  }

  button {
    font-size: 12px;
  }

  .confirmation {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}
These media queries apply different styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px (tablet) and 480px (mobile). The styles adjust the font size, padding, and logo size to make the website more readable and visually appealing on smaller screens.

You can further enhance the website's responsiveness by:

Testing on various devices and screen sizes: Make sure to test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks and functions well on all platforms.

Optimizing images: Ensure that the images used on your website are optimized and load quickly, especially on mobile devices. You can use tools like ImageOptim to optimize your images.

Implementing touch-friendly UI elements: Make sure buttons, links, and other interactive elements are large enough and have enough padding to be easily tapped on touch screens.

Improving text readability: Adjust font sizes and line heights based on the screen size to maintain readability on smaller screens.

Utilizing fluid grids and flexible images: Use percentage-based widths and max-width properties to make sure your layout and images adapt to different screen sizes.

Remember to continually test your website on different devices and screen sizes, and gather feedback from users to ensure a great UI/UX.

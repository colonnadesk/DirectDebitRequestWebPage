Now I would like to use existing logo I have file Colonnade-logo.png on my local drive. How can I add it to the website?

To use your existing logo in the website, follow these steps:

Step 1: Move the logo to your project folder
Create a folder named assets in your src folder and move the Colonnade-logo.png file into the newly created assets folder. The path should look like this: src/assets/Colonnade-logo.png.

Step 2: Import the logo in your App.js file
In your src/App.js file, import the logo using the following syntax:

javascript
Copy code
import logo from './assets/Colonnade-logo.png';
Step 3: Use the logo in your JSX
Replace the <div> element with the logo class in your src/App.js file with an <img> element using the imported logo:

javascript
Copy code
// ...
return (
  <div className="App">
    <img src={logo} alt="Colonnade Logo" className="logo" />
    {/*...*/}
  </div>
);
// ...
Save your changes and refresh the website. The logo should now be displayed at the top of the page.

If you want to adjust the size of the logo, you can modify the .logo class in the src/App.css file. For example, you can set the width and height as follows:

css
Copy code
.logo {
  width: 180px;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
This will ensure that the logo maintains the specified dimensions of 180x50px.

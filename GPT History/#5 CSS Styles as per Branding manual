Prompt: Thank you now it works as previously. Let's move forward. 
I don't want to use any out of the box css frameworks. 
Instead the requirement is to follow our branding manual. Here are requirements:
1. Logo is an image, please use some placeholder for now with dimensions of 180x50px.
2. There are two primary colors #000000,  #E4002B. And multiple secondary colors:  #FAF7F7, #FC9C3D, #F2C4AB, #4AABC9, #007AA1,  #003859. Also there are some tints. But let's stick to primary and secondary for now.
3. For typhography priary font is Open Sans, secondary Arial
Please use these requirements to style the form with beautifuly looking CSS, so our page can stand out. Please act as an designer having 20+ years of experience.
Also align the form so it has good UI/UX. The user expirience is very important.

I understand your requirements. I'll provide you with CSS code to style your form according to your branding manual. Add the following CSS code to your src/App.css file:

css
Copy code
/* Reset styles and fonts */
html, body, div, span, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, a, label, input, button {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
  font-size: 100%;
  font: inherit;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}

/* Typography */
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* App container */
.App {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: #FAF7F7;
}

/* Logo */
.logo {
  width: 180px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #E4002B;
  margin: 20px;
}

/* Form container */
.form-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 40px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

/* Form elements */
form {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: 20px;
  width: 100%;
}

label {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #003859;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

input {
  border: 2px solid #E4002B;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 100%;
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 16px;
}

button {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 16px;
  background-color: #E4002B;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  align-self: center;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #000000;
}

/* Confirmation page */
.confirmation {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 20px;
  color: #003859;
  font-size: 20px;
}
Then, update your src/App.js file to include the logo and apply the new styles:

javascript
Copy code
// Import the Open Sans font
import './App.css';
import "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap";

function App() {
  // ...existing code...

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="logo"></div>
      {!submitted ? (
        <div className="form-container">
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            {/*...form elements...*/}
          </form>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div className="confirmation">
          <h2>Thank you for submitting your information!</h2>
          <p>We have received your direct debit request.</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
These updates should give your form a unique look, adhering to the branding manual's specifications. The form now has proper spacing, utilizes the specified colors, and features Open Sans as the primary font. The logo placeholder is also included at the top of the page.

Feel free to customize the CSS and components further to align with your branding manual. You may want to consider the following enhancements for your website:

Add a navigation bar: Including a navigation bar with your company's logo and primary links will help users navigate your website with ease.

Integrate responsive design: Ensure that your website looks good and functions well on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Use media queries in your CSS to adjust the layout and styling based on screen size.

Use secondary colors for highlights and accents: Utilize your secondary colors to highlight important information or create visual interest in your design. For instance, you could use a secondary color for buttons or form field focus states.

Add footer with contact information and links: A footer containing your company's contact information, social media links, and other relevant information adds credibility and aids user engagement.

Enhance typography: Pay attention to typography by setting appropriate font sizes, line heights, and font weights for headings and body text. This will improve readability and make your website more visually appealing.

Add whitespace: Incorporate whitespace to separate different sections and elements of your website, which will enhance the overall user experience.

Add animations and transitions: Use subtle animations and transitions to make your website more interactive and engaging.

Remember that user experience is crucial for a successful website. Continually test and iterate on your design, and gather feedback from users to ensure that you are meeting their needs and expectations.
